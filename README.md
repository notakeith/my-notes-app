### Final Project for the Java Course at Synergy University

:pencil2: **Task:** Create a web application "Notes" that allows the user to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These operations should be implemented according to the REST design pattern.

:page_with_curl: **Project Requirements:**
- A note should be a string of text
- There should be a welcome page with a link to the list of all notes
- The page with the list of all notes should have a link to the page for creating a new note
- It should be possible to click on a note and go to its separate page
- On the note page, there should be options to edit and delete the note
- The URLs of all pages should follow the REST design pattern

:computer: **What I Did:**
- With the help of the great site Stack Overflow, I wrote a web application using the Spring framework. The project was successfully defended, and I completed the course successfully.

:open_file_folder: **Knowledge Stack I Needed:**
- HTML/CSS (at a basic level)
- Java (at a beginner level)
- Spring (at a beginner level)

:school: **What I Learned:**
- How to write simple web applications using Spring
- How to work with Git (i've used vsc GitLab hosted on my ancient laptop on Docker over Ubuntu Server)  
- Reviewed previously learned knowledge and practiced writing clean code
